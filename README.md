# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the service) using machine learning models based on customer behavioral and subscription data.

# 🔍 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical business problem. Retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a labeled dataset to train a classification model that predicts the likelihood of customer churn.

# 🧠 Model & Approach
Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.

Model: XGBoost Classifier

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

# 📁 Dataset
train.csv: Labeled training data with customer features and churn status.

test.csv: Unlabeled data for prediction.

Target column: Churn

# 🛠️ Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

# 🚀 How to Run
